  # Privacy Policy for Cats Hub — Expert Insights on Cats

At Cats Hub, we’re passionate about sharing expert insights and helpful information about cats. Your trust means everything to us, and we’re committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how we use cookies, our approach to analytics and ads, and how you can contact us to manage your information. Please read this carefully — it’s straightforward and designed to keep you informed.

## What Data We Collect

We collect certain information to improve your experience on Cats Hub and to provide you with relevant content. Here’s what we gather:

### Information You Provide

- **Device Information:** We collect details about the device you’re using, such as the type of device, browser type, IP address, and operating system.
- **Location Data:** We may approximate your location based on your IP address to tailor content or ads.

### Cookies and Tracking Technologies

## How We Use Cookies

Cookies are small text files stored on your device that help us understand how you use our site and improve it accordingly. Here’s what we do with cookies:

- **Essential Cookies:** These are necessary for the website to function properly, such as remembering your preferences or login status.
- **Analytics Cookies:** We use cookies to analyze how visitors use our site — which pages are popular, how long visitors stay, and where they come from. This helps us improve our content.
- **Advertising Cookies:** These cookies are used to show you relevant ads based on your interests and browsing behavior.

You can manage or disable cookies through your browser settings at any time. Keep in mind, disabling cookies might limit some features of our website.

We may display ads on Cats Hub to support our free content. These ads may be served by third-party advertising networks, which use cookies and tracking technologies to show you relevant ads based on your interests.

We do not control the data collection practices of these third-party ad providers. However, you can opt out of targeted advertising through various tools, such as the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://optout.aboutads.info/) or [Network Advertising Initiative](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/).
