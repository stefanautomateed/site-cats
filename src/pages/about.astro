## Our Editorial Process

Quality and accuracy are at the core of everything we do. Our content creation process involves rigorous research, fact-checking, and editorial oversight. Each article begins with thorough research from reputable sources, including scientific studies, veterinary guidelines, and expert opinions. Our writers then craft clear, helpful content, which is reviewed multiple times to ensure clarity and correctness before publication.

## How We Source Images

Visuals are an important part of our content, helping illustrate key points and enhance your understanding. We source images from a combination of licensed stock photo providers, our own photography, and user submissions. All images are carefully selected to be relevant, high-quality, and respectful of animal welfare. Whenever we use photos of cats, we ensure they are ethically sourced and reflect natural, healthy, and happy feline behavior.
